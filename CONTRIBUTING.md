# Contributing

If you'd like to help feel free to make a PR. There's no linting but if you'd like to lint and setup a linting standard it'd be appreciated.

Tests will be implemented soon if not already and it'd be nice for you to add tests if you are contributing a new feature.

Please only make quality contributions, open an Issue for typos and small bugs.
