# EasyModels
Easily find and view pre-trained AI models through the command line

# How it works


Simply install from pip:

```
pip install easymodels
easymodels
```

or clone this repo and run:
```
python setup.py install
easymodels
```

This will bring up a command line tool that will guide you through grabbing whatever models are available through the modelzoo API.
